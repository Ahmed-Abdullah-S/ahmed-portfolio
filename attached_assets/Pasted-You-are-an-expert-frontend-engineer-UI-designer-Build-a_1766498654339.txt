You are an expert frontend engineer & UI designer. Build a premium, mobile-first developer portfolio inspired by modern dark purple glassmorphism UIs (similar to the attached screenshot style). Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript and follow best practices: clean architecture, accessibility, performance, SEO, and great animations.

GOALS
- Create an attractive, interactive portfolio for a software developer.
- Mobile-first UI that also looks perfect on desktop.
- Smooth animations, elegant gradients, and polished micro-interactions.
- Easy to update content from a single config file (no hardcoded content scattered around).

TECH STACK (use these)
- Next.js (latest) App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Framer Motion for animations
- lucide-react icons
- next-themes for theme support (dark by default)
- next-intl for i18n (Arabic + English) with RTL/LTR support
- zod for validation (contact form)
- react-hook-form for forms
- next-seo OR built-in metadata API for SEO (choose best)
- MDX for blog/articles (optional but preferred)

DESIGN SYSTEM (important)
- Dark theme as default: deep purple/black background with subtle noise + gradient blobs.
- Glass cards: translucent panels with soft borders + blur.
- Primary accent: purple/violet with secondary cyan hints.
- Typography: modern, clear (use a good Google Font, e.g., “Cairo” for Arabic + “Inter” for English).
- Animations must be subtle: fade/slide on scroll, hover tilt on cards, button ripple/glow, tab transitions.
- RTL: Arabic pages should align RTL automatically and still keep icons/layout clean.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
Create these pages/routes with App Router:
1) "/" Home
   - Header with avatar, name, short bio, location, role
   - Primary CTAs: “Contact Me”, “View Projects”
   - Sections: Featured Projects, Latest Articles, Skills Highlights
2) "/projects"
   - List of projects with filters (All / Web / Backend / AI / Open Source)
   - Each project card clickable -> project details page
3) "/projects/[slug]"
   - Project details: overview, stack, screenshots gallery, key features, links (GitHub, Live Demo)
4) "/articles"
   - List of articles (MDX) with tags, reading time, search
5) "/articles/[slug]"
   - Article page with good typography, TOC, code blocks, share buttons
6) "/profile" (or "/about")
   - “Profile” style page like the screenshot: stats, about text, skills tags, experience timeline, education
7) "/contact"
   - Contact form + social links + copy-to-clipboard email

NAVIGATION UX (must feel like the screenshot)
- Mobile bottom navigation bar with 4 tabs:
  Home, Projects, Articles, Profile
- On desktop: top nav + optional bottom nav hidden.
- Active tab indicator with animated pill/glow.
- Add a floating action button (FAB) on mobile (optional) for quick contact.

CONTENT MANAGEMENT
- Create a single file: "src/content/site.ts" containing all data:
  - personal info (name, title, bio, location, socials)
  - skills list + categories
  - experience timeline
  - education
  - projects array (slug, title, description, tags, stack, links, images)
  - featuredProjects list
  - stats (years exp, projects count, etc.)
- Articles content in "src/content/articles/*.mdx"
- The UI must read everything from these sources.

COMPONENTS
- Build reusable components:
  - <AppShell /> layout with nav
  - <GlassCard />, <GradientButton />, <SectionTitle />
  - <ProjectCard />, <ArticleCard />, <SkillPill />
  - <StatBadge /> (numbers like 12 / 32 / +5 style)
  - <ThemeToggle /> (optional)
  - <LanguageToggle /> (Arabic/English)
  - <AnimatedBackground /> (subtle gradient blobs + noise)
  - <PageTransition /> (Framer Motion)

ANIMATIONS (Framer Motion)
- Page transitions between routes (subtle)
- Scroll reveal for sections/cards
- Hover effects for cards (slight lift + glow)
- Tab transitions for filters
- Keep performance good: reduced motion support for users who prefer it.

ACCESSIBILITY & BEST PRACTICES
- Semantic HTML, ARIA for nav, buttons, form fields.
- Keyboard navigation works everywhere.
- Use Next.js Image component for images.
- Optimize fonts and metadata.
- Add proper OpenGraph metadata and sitemap.
- Use loading states and empty states.
- Use error boundaries / not-found pages.

STYLING DETAILS
- Use Tailwind + CSS variables from shadcn/ui.
- Create a consistent spacing scale.
- Dark background with:
  - radial gradient blobs
  - subtle grain/noise overlay
  - soft border strokes
- Buttons: purple gradient + glow on hover.
- Cards: glass effect, rounded 2xl, shadow soft.

FEATURES TO INCLUDE
- Projects filtering + search.
- Articles list search.
- Copy email button.
- Contact form that validates with zod and shows success state (mock submit is fine).
- Optional: “Now Playing” / “Currently Building” small widget on Home.

DELIVERABLES
- Provide the full Next.js project structure.
- Ensure it runs with:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev
- Include a README with:
  - how to edit content
  - how to add projects/articles
  - deployment notes (Vercel)

INITIAL CONTENT (use placeholders but realistic)
- Name: Ahmed Abdullah
- Role: Junior Software Engineer
- Location: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
- Bio: short, strong, developer-focused
- 5-7 projects (mix: REGA integrations, Umbraco components, FastAPI services, React apps)
- 4-6 articles (AI/dev/productivity)
- Skills: React, Next.js, TypeScript, FastAPI, SQL, Docker, Umbraco, CI/CD, Accessibility, RTL/LTR

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Make it look premium and close in vibe to the screenshot: dark purple, clean, modern, mobile-app feeling.
- Code must be clean, typed, and maintainable.
- No heavy libraries beyond the list.
- Keep images as local placeholders in /public (or simple gradients) so it works offline.

Now generate the full codebase accordingly.
